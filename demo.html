				Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
				<br>
				That you're alive and have a soul
				<br>
				But it takes someone to come around
				<br>
				To show you how
				<br>
				She's the tear in my heart
				<br>
				I'm alive
				<br>
				She's the tear in my heart
				<br>
				I'm on fire
				<br>
				She's the tear in my heart
				<br>
				Take me higher
				<br>
				Than I've ever been

				The songs on the radio are okay
				<br>
				But my taste in music is your face
				<br>
				And it takes a song to come around
				<br>
				To show you how

				I'm alive
				<br>
				She's the tear in my heart
				<br>
				I'm on fire

				Than I've ever been
				<br>
				You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
				<br>
				But that's okay I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
				<br>
				I'm driving here I sit
				<br>
				Cursing my government
				<br>
				For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
